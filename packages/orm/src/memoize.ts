/**
 * A memoizer to use with redux-orm
 * selectors. When the memoized function is first run,
 * the memoizer will remember the models that are accessed
 * during that function run.
 *
 * On subsequent runs, the memoizer will check if those
 * models' states have changed compared to the previous run.
 *
 * Memoization algorithm operates like this:
 *
 * 1. Has the selector been run before? If not, go to 5.
 *
 * 2. If the selector has other input selectors in addition to the
 *    ORM state selector, check their results for equality with the previous results.
 *    If they aren't equal, go to 5.
 *
 * 3. Is the ORM state referentially equal to the previous ORM state the selector
 *    was called with? If yes, return the previous result.
 *
 * 4. Check which Model's instances the selector has accessed on previous runs.
 *    Check for equality with each of those states versus their states in the
 *    previous ORM state. If all of them are equal, return the previous result.
 *
 * 5. Run the selector. Check the Session object used by the selector for
 *    which Model's states were accessed, and merge them with the previously
 *    saved information about accessed models (if-else branching can change
 *    which models are accessed on different inputs). Save the ORM state and
 *    other arguments the selector was called with, overriding previously
 *    saved values. Save the selector result. Return the selector result.
